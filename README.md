# NER-system-Of-Chhattisgarhi-Dialect
This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for the Chhattisgarhi dialect and its regional variations.
NER is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that automatically identifies entities such as persons, locations, organizations, dates, and more from text.

Since Chhattisgarhi and its dialects are underrepresented in NLP research, this project aims to build a resource and system to support future computational linguistics work for these languages.
